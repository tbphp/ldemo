Hi user, Welcome to CyberLand! 👏👏👏

CyberLand is a self-custodial wallet. users are the holders of their private key and mnemonic, having full control over their assets. This also means that they are solely responsible for their assets. Please bear these principles in mind for your asset security：⚠️⚠️⚠️

✊ If you lose your mnemonic phrase and you haven’t backed it up, it can’t be retrieved. So after creating the wallet, please backup the phrase immediately.
✊ Keep the mnemonics and  private key away from the internet and do not lose them.
❌ Don’t import the mnemonic or private key to unknown third-party wallets or websites.
❌ Don't  give token approval to the scammer.

You can contact us via support@cybergames.me to get more support.❤️❤️❤️
EOL,
